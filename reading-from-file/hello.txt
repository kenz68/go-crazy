On a sunny drive on the busy roads of Tokyo, over the rainbow bridge and facing the
ocean, my daughter Mei and I are having one of these philosophical talks.
Among the slur of questions she had ready for me, like “what is work for?,” she was
telling me about her need to have someone monitor her and give her deadlines. While
at the time of this writing, she’s barely 20 and hasn’t started a full-blown professional
career yet, she is right in the sense that the need to have deadlines and a purpose is at the
core of many adults’ professional lives.
At the very root of a school system, you are being told what to complete, and by what
date. You do not have input regarding the what or the when. A regular office worker is
told to finish their tasks by the fifth of next month, for example, and some authors are
told to finish three chapters by the end of the month.
That de facto need of what to do and by when happens very early in your career.
I am in favor of looking at things from a different angle. You should set your own
deadlines, and you should be in control of those deadlines. You have a goal, you set
milestones to achieve that goal, and you work on walking that path to that goal.
You want to live your own life and reach your own goals, not someone else’s.
Although I am critical about many of his actions, Elon Musk does not have someone
telling him when to land a rocket on Mars. He has his own schedule. He owns his
schedule. He owns his life.
